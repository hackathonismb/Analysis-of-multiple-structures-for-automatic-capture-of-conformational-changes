# Analysis Of Multiple Structures For Automatic Capture of Conformational Changes
## Tools for Analyzing Structural Sets- Exploring Protein Conformations

### Task 
We are developing sensitive methods to detect subtle differences between protein structures, by leveraging large datasets and expanding iCn3D distance functions analysis feature. As a result, we may identify different interactions which can cause difference in structures. Recognizing different structures will allow us to dig deeper and determine mechanisms that cause the difference.

### WorkFlow

### Applications 
- Evaluate experimental structures in reference to AlphaFold structures
- Understand variations in protein conformation within families
- Analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories
- Discern subtle conformational differences eliduded by large dataset analysis

### Future Add-Ons
- Create an interactive Dendrogram and intergrate the figure to iCn3D
- Expand analysis parameters to handle arbitrary alignments such as different chain identifers and different residue numbering between structures
